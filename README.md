# imp-coding-questions
A curated list of coding interview questions that I am practicing to save time during an interview preparation. Questions are collected from different resources like Blind75,  Grind75 which are mainly sourced from LeetCode. But I have also included other important questions which I faced during my tech interviews and which are most likely to be asked from the experience of other users on internet.
